# FireAphisClearerTool (FACT) is a small project intended to make a life
# with ClearCase a little bit happier. The project tries to achieve the
# goal in two ways:
#
# 1. Create an intuitive front end for IBM Rational ClearCase SCM.
# 2. Create a library that simplifies the process of development of scripts
#    that interact with ClearCase.
#
# Execute bin/fact to enter the interactive mode. Consult Fact::ClearCase
# for the list of the supported ClearCase operations.
