Purpose
=======

FireAphisClearerTool (FACT) is a small project intended to make a life
with ClearCase a little bit happier. The project tries to achieve the
goal in two ways:

1. Create an intuitive front end for IBM Rational ClearCase SCM.
2. Create a library that simplifies the process of development of scripts
   that interact with ClearCase.

Development status
==================

The project is in the development state and doesn't have stable realeases
yet. The development is done in short iterations, each delivering a small 
but complete feature. A couple of first releases will be released as beta 
releases for the field testing, before a stable version is released. The 
first iteration is scheduled to be complete by the end of May 2011.
